There is a 'Book Borrower' table that maintains a comprehensive list of all individuals borrowing books. New books can be added to the system by entering details such as ISBN, Publisher ID, Book Title, Author Name, and the number of copies available. Additionally, the system allows the addition of new book borrowers, including information like the book name, borrower's email, borrower's address, and the number of books issued. Furthermore, book publishers can be added to the system with details such as the publisher's name, address, and mobile number.
